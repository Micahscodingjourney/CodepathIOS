## App Brainstorming (Step 4)
My favourite Applications & their best features:

Subway Surfers: Global leaderboard allowing users to see where they place amongst global comeption, colllaboration with comapnies to provide exclusive skins, and unique gadgets to retain engagement whilst playing
Tiktok: The well trained algorithim making it easy fro users to spend hours on the app without noticing, easy communication between friends via smart UI design, and allowed posts for a user different audiences(friends, public, etc)
Youtube:Tredning pasge to catch up on daily news, Integration fo creator stores for a creators' business, and Subtitles for those which speak languages besides those spoken in videos or are hard of hearing 

A cool app that would very well be useful in this day and age is "uplift". This app would allow for proper tracking of workout progress by giving the user statistical analysis of their progress while letting them see what type of workouts their friends are performing on a day to day basis. Users may even see what their favourite sports teams are doing and can replicate a very similar wokout to them so they may feel like part of the team all whilst having fun. 

## Notes

I did not face any challenges in the Xcode portion of the prework I would just say it took some time moving everything to the github repository.
